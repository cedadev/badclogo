This contains the bits needed to make a scalable version of the BADC logo.  
It doesn't *exactly* match the existing logo, as I couldn't find a program 
that actually contained the correct contour range (Bryan reckons it's 
probably lost), but it's extremely close!

At present this is an IDL program to write a .eps file, but dream of 
SVG...

NB plot.dat and plot.nc both contain the same data.  (plot.nc is more
friendly for non-IDL use!)

Where does it come from?  Okay, well it's all pieced together a bit... :-) 
for purposes of running it, everything in this directory should actually 
be self-contained (and only plot.dat and plot-postscript.pro is needed), 
but for completeness here are some notes on the provenance.  Note that 
some of the steps described below were performed interactively.

Data is PV at 850K calculated from UKMO assimilation, 
/badc/ukmo-assim/data/standard/1992/ppassm_ucorf_y92_m10_d11_h12.pp
using PV routines supplied in /badc/ukmo-assim/software/supplier

colour values were taken off existing image badc-logo-1000.png

contour levels were worked out empirically to match above logo
as closely as possible

map projection was taken from an old program of Sam's (which also 
contained the necessary clues about where to find the data)
