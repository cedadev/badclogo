Data is PV at 850K calculated from UKMO assimilation, 
/badc/ukmo-assim/data/standard/1992/ppassm_ucorf_y92_m10_d11_h12.pp
using PV routines supplied in /badc/ukmo-assim/software/supplier

This directory contains copies of the files referred to above, and could 
be used if there was ever a need to re-generate the PV (although the 
plot.nc file in the parent directory already has the PV, so this shouldn't 
be necessary).

The example Fortran main program acsasm_exam_v5a.f is set up to do 
pretty much what is needed (read a file and calculate PV).  May need
tweaking slightly.
